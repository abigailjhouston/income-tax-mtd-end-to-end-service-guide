<h1 id="business-and-property-income">Business and Property Income</h1>
<p>The steps in this section (up to the End of Period Statement) will be the element that will be mandated for digital record keeping and submission through software under MTD (Making Tax Digital).</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-obligations">Retrieving obligations</h2>
<p>Obligations are a set of date periods for which a customer must provide summary income and expense data.</p>
<p>Each obligation has a start date and an end date which together define the obligation period. For MTD, each business has multiple obligations which are based on its accounting period.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may take up to an hour for a change to an obligation to be updated within HMRC systems.</p>
<p>Each obligation has an update period, which is a period of time during which the customer can submit summarised income and expense data.</p>
<p>An update period might be a single day or the duration of the whole obligation period. Data may be provided as a single update covering the whole period, or as multiple, smaller updates.</p>
<p>Once a business or agent has completed authentication and granted access to the software, the software can then use our APIs to request the information the customer provided at sign up and to find out the customer’s update obligation dates. The software must make customers aware of their obligations.</p>
<p>Actions to take are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get">List All Businesses</a> endpoint provides a list of all the customer’s business income sources, along with the business ID which the software will need to send to HMRC</li>
<li>the <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BbusinessId%7D/get">Retrieve Business Details</a> endpoint will provide the information HMRC holds for a specific self-employment or property business</li>
</ul>
<p>You can retrieve a customer&rsquo;s obligations through the following endpoint:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/obligations-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1obligations~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1income-and-expenditure/get">Retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) Income and Expenditure Obligations</a> - provides obligation dates for all self-employment and property businesses, including grace periods and whether or not obligations have been met</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the obligations for property obligations cover both FHL and non-FHL.</p>
<h2 id="submit-income-and-expense-updates-for-self-employment-and-property-businesses">Submit income and expense updates for self-employment and property businesses</h2>
<p>Businesses and agents who represent them, will be required to provide summary-level information of their business income and expenses (transactional information to be kept digitally) on a quarterly basis or more often.</p>
<p>The quarterly obligations are initially created based on the accounting period for the income source. The deadline for meeting a quarterly obligation is one month after the obligation period end date. The software should present these deadlines clearly to the customer and prompt them to submit information when the update is due. Submissions of summary-level information cannot span an obligation period. If it does, the software will need to send two updates that fall into different obligations.</p>
<p>The software package will need to convert the transactional information into summary totals for each category, for example, expenses by category.</p>
<p>HMRC has provided APIs to enable the software to be able to send the summary information to HMRC for each income source and allow HMRC to provide a calculation based on all the information we have received to date.</p>
<p>When the update is received, HMRC checks if the customer is signed up to MTD, if the submission is coming from an agent and if that agent is subscribed to agent services and authorised to act on behalf of the client if not, an error is returned.</p>
<p>Note: If you still get the error and the client insists they have met all of the scenarios, check they have used the correct Government Gateway credentials when granting access to the software.</p>

</ul>
<p>The service will include a number of business validation rules to ensure that all submissions are cross-validated before being accepted. HMRC cannot apply these rules without knowing that no further submission (APIs calls) will be sent by the customer for the period being validated.</p>
<p>Once all the information has been submitted to HMRC for that period, the software must use the <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/4.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D/post">Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>The periodic information does not need to be provided in one go. Customers can submit data as frequently as they like, for example, monthly.</li>
<li>The customer does not have to declare that the submissions are ‘complete and correct’ (there is no ‘accuracy’ statement required at this point), only that the customer must indicate that they do not intend to provide any additional information at this point. There is nothing to stop them from providing additional information anytime by resubmitting the update period with any changes that have been made to the previous submission.</li>
<li>  In some cases, the obligation can take up to an hour to be confirmed as met.</li>
<li>  The met obligation must be presented clearly to the customer in the software.</li>
<li>  Businesses can  also check this information in their Business Tax Account.</li>
<li>  The customer will not receive any communication from HMRC to confirm that the obligation has been met. The software should provide this confirmation to the customer. For property businesses, an update for either FHL or Non-FHL for the full quarter will mark the obligation as fulfilled, even if they have both income types.</li>
<li>There are separate income and expenses period summary endpoints for submitting historic data prior to the 2021-22 tax year (back to 2017-2018). For later years, use the main endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each update period cannot overlap the previous one, for example:</p>
<p>Update 1 – 6 April to 1 May is accepted<br />
Update 2 – 2 May to 31 May is accepted<br />
Update 3 – 28 May to 6 June is rejected because it overlaps with previous updates</p>

<h3 id="business-or-agent-able-to-submit-end-of-period-statement-through-software">Business or Agent able to submit End of Period Statement through software</h3>
<p>End of period statement (EOPS) is the process that allows the customer to finalise the profit or loss for any one source of business income. An EOPS must be completed for each source of business income the taxpayer has (just as the current Income Tax process for the SA103, SA105 and SA106 schedules) so, for example, if a customer has one self-employment business and one property business they will have to complete two EOPS.</p>
<p>EOPS relates to the accounting period or basis period for each source of business income and cannot be completed before the end of that period. Customers can complete their EOPS at any point after the end of the accounting period and do not have to wait until the 31 January deadline. We would like to encourage this behaviour where possible as it helps customers manage their business income in line with the business accounts. However, the deadline to complete is 31 January, Year 2.</p>
<p>The process will take into account all the periodic and annual data already provided by the customer throughout the year.</p>
<p>Customers must make sure they are confident with the information they have provided and add any additional information they have. This is likely to include tax and accounting adjustments, allowances or reliefs.</p>

<p>Making changes to previously submitted data during and after an EOPS declaration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the information the customer has previously provided relating to that source of business income is not correct or complete (for example the previous information provided fails further validation, or a periodic update is missing), then the EOPS declaration is rejected, and error messages are returned. The changes must be made to any relevant periodic or annual summaries and then follow the existing process of submitting updates and triggering the calculation before attempting the declaration again.</p></li>
<li><p>if there are no error failures, it is recommended that customers review any warning messages they have at this point or earlier as warnings will cause a failure at final declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>if after the customer has completed their EOPS declaration, they need to revise any of the data relating to that source of business income then they must make the change to the relevant periodic or annual summaries and follow the existing process of submitting updates and triggering the calculation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: making changes to data for previously submitted periods is covered in the &ldquo;<a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/businessandpropertyincome.html#making-changes-to-previously-submitted-data">making changes to previously submitted data&rdquo;</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="view-previously-submitted-updates">View previously submitted updates</h2>
<p>A customer may want to retrieve previously submitted data, for example before making a change the customer may want to request the last update provided before sending in any changes. If the customer has recently started using your software, you may need to retrieve previous data.</p>
<h3 id="income-and-expense-updates-periodic">Income and expense updates (Periodic)</h3>
<p>The software can use the list all self-employment or property update periods endpoints to retrieve the list of updates made for that income source, or to find one or more period IDs. The period ID is then used with the ‘get a self-employment/property (FHL or Non FHL) periodic update’ endpoint to retrieve data for that update.</p>
<h3 id="annual-accounting-adjustments">Annual accounting adjustments</h3>
<p>Within the annual self-assessment process, annual accounting adjustments are applied to income and expenses before the business or agent submits their tax return to HMRC. Within Making Tax Digital as the income and expenses are submitted to HMRC at least quarterly
during the active accounting period, this means a new process to accommodate these adjustments is required.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-annual-accounting-adjustments">Submitting annual accounting adjustments</h3>
<p>After an accounting period has ended, a business or agent may need to submit accounting adjustments to the income and expenses that have been submitted throughout the year.</p>

<p>The List Loss Claims endpoint has been extended to include a sequence number that shows the order in which loss claims will be used.</p>
<p>A user with multiple businesses may choose to list their businesses so that they can obtain the Business IDs of their active businesses. A developer can then return information about a specific business or retrieve obligations quoting a <code>businessID</code>, so the user knows when they need to submit information.</p>
<p>Where more than one business income source has incurred a loss at the end of the tax year and the user has opted to carry-sideways these losses (by listing loss claims) they will see the current order in which these loss claims will be applied.  If they wish to change the order they can amend the loss claim order preference and list loss claims to review.</p>
<p>Not all loss claims will have a sequence number to indicate the order of use (currently only carry-sideways, future functionality will enable you to carry backwards). When changing the order, all the loss claims of the same type (for example carry-sideways) must be included in the submission.</p>
<p>To obtain the <code>businessID</code> a developer will need to call the List All businesses endpoint.  This will then permit obligations to be retrieved for a particular Business ID so that the user is clear by when they must submit their business data.
Once loss claims have been generated a user will be able to list them and determine if the order in which they are used needs to change.</p>
